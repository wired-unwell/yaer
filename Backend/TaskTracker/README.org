A small task manager app for [[https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker][this exercise]].

* Status [8/8]
- [X] Add,
- [X] Update,
- [X] and Delete tasks
- [X] Mark a task as in progress
- [X] or done
- [X] List all tasks
- [X] List all tasks that are not done
- [X] List all tasks that are in progress

* A task:

- [X] id: A unique identifier for the task
- [ ] description: A short description of the task
- [X] status: The status of the task (todo, in-progress, done)
- [X] createdAt: The date and time when the task was created
- [ ] updatedAt: The date and time when the task was last updated

* Enhancements and Extras

- [ ] Due-date to filter list.
- A =directory= option to change the tasks file.

* Notes

I can't believe I receive HTTP errors when I try to install some packages or
libraries with pip. This is unfair.

Lua rocks.
